## Installation
No extra necessary libraries should be required beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run fine with no issues using Python (versions 3.\*).

## Project Motivation
For this project, I wanted to use the House Price listings with their various features and attributes to model a Linear Regression ML model to predict house prices. I used the data to clean, observe trends and correlation between the variables and target variable to form a ML model. The key steps involved:
1. Data Cleaning & Wrangling
2. Data Analysis
3. Model Training, Evaluation & Testing
4. Predictions

The dataset for this project has been acquired from Kaggle.

## File Descriptions
There is one single jupyter notebook that process the dataset (csv file) and goes through all the key steps mentioned in the Project Motivation section. The notebook is self-explanatory and markdown cells have been used to guide through the thought process.

The data_descriptions.txt file describes and explain all the variables pertaining to the dataset. 

The train.csv and test.csv files have been used to Train and Test the ML model respectively.

The submissions.csv file is the file containing all the predictions for the final data to be predicted upon. This file was used for the Kaggle competition submission.

## Results
The model evaluation and scores have been included into the Jupyter Notebook itself. For the final test data, a RMSE of 0.16388 was observed.

## Licensing, Authors and Acknowledgments
Must give credit to Kaggle for the data. The data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
